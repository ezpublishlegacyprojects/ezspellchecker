Copyright notices
-----------------

- Access checking while importing documents with images in them is not complete.
  The access to create images are not checked properly.
- While exporting, if the user has not access to read images, they are just ignored. 
  Should replace them with a dummy image which says "no access".
- Importing document with images and storing the images in media does not work properly.


Known Bugs
----------
* Drag and drop does not trigger an update
Markup (curly lines) are not moved/removed in real time, for instance if a key is held down the markup won't be updated until it's released.
The spelling is checked on all words, even the currently active one. It should only check a word once a separator has been entered after it.
</ul>
